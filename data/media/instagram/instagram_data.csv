Saturday, Feb 15 at Frontyard, 228 Illawarra Rd, Marrickville NSW 2204
2-4pm


It’s been hot and it’s only getting hotter. We have different experiences of heat, and different ways of living with it.

The thermal dynamics of hormone and climate fluctuations re-casts ‘climate change’ as an intimate experience, linking our diverse bodies and environments. Aside from the escape hatch of climate-controlled environments, we reach for or rely on physical, sensory things around us, that we use, inhabit or don, for support. At best these ‘climatic objects’ assist and comfort, and, at worst, they can amplify our fears about our capacity to weather the ‘weather to come‘.

This workshop is about exploring how we weather dynamic climates, inside and out with climatic objects, which might be a hammock or a hat, a piece of visual art or music, a bicycle, a bodily movement, a slice of watermelon, a fan. Hormonal fluctuations of bodies can be thought of as the body’s own weather from childhood to end-of-life, influencing feeling and experience. Our bodies are not usually naked to the world but wrapped and nested in other environments - from garments to dwellings, which subtly or overtly, affect us.

Instruction for participants: Bring a portable object (or a picture of it) or a performance to the workshop that will help you to tell a story about experiencing dynamic climates that only you can tell.

This object might connect you to a place, body, practice or condition, living with thermal fluctuations (heat, humidity, sweat, chill, wind, dry, wet) and reflect your experiences of weathering dynamic climates inside and out. Or it might reflect how external encounters with weather affects our interactions with things and intersects with the dynamic hormones and weather felt by our bodies.

https://www.instagram.com/frontyardorg/,English,2024-11-17,21,0,"Hi friends,

I am hosting another group Tarot reading session at Frontyard on Saturday November 23rd 3-5pm. Come along!

This is the third in a series of readings focusing on a keyword. Last time, we spoke about RAGE. The guiding word for this session will be CRISIS. See blurb below.  

The way I practice Tarot is slightly different to a traditional Tarot reading. In a typical one-on-one reading, the querent (or questioner) comes to the reader with a problem for which they are seeking guidance. The reader lays out a spread and interprets the cards, tailoring the reading to the querent’s mindset.

I read with small and large groups of people. Together, we formulate a question based on our shared feelings, problems, and ideas. I facilitate the reading, but I try not to exert too much control. For me, a group Tarot reading is akin to the best tutorial discussions―rigorous, probing, collaborative, compassionate, energising, unsettling. I like that Tarot opens a space for interpretation and negotiation. You don’t need to know much about Tarot to participate!

?

I am growing skeptical of the word ‘crisis’. I think, read, and write the word crisis on a near daily basis. To invoke the language of crisis is to summon a heightened emotional state, a sense of urgency, a will to act. Polycrisis refers to the intermingling of crises. However, it’s a language that feels strangely inadequate, a generic signifier of badness that masks specific and material conditions. Does it offer meaningful choices or does it perpetuate reactive tendencies? I have come to think of crisis as a blockage, where intensity accumulates with nowhere to go. What could replace the word crisis? Do we need new forms, languages, and practices to overcome this paralysis? 

If any of this resonates with you, come along and we’ll work it out together. ?",picture,活动宣传,frontyard-projects

Rage has been plaguing me of late. In many ways, rage is the logical response to witnessing a genocide in real time. There’s a difference between anger and the tumultuous overflow of rage. Sometimes rage is energising and inspiring. Other times, rage can be misdirected or exhausting. You might feel like you’re spinning on the spot or launching into multiple directions at once. I think of bell hooks on ‘killing rage’ (1996) and anti-racist struggle. She reflects on dealing with rage over time C repressing it, unleashing it, fearing it, valuing it: “(rage) burns in my psyche with an intensity that creates clarity. It is a constructive healing rage.” What does it mean to honour rage? How to make the most of your rage? What are we doing in between intense bouts of rage?

Radio Insomnia returns to Eora/Sydney for a broadcast as part of (((Amplify: Story, Resistance, Radio)))’s takeover. The exhibition/pirate radio explores the importance of amplification and listening in urban politics.

We will be live from @frontyardorg with discussions and listening sessions. Join us in person, or online via our chatroom.

Nov 15th - 16th 2023
Midnight - 6 am (AEST; UTC+11)
Frontyard : 228 Illawarra Rd, Marrickville
Program and Tune in:
https://insomnia.radio.fm/

We’ve picked up some of the loose ends from our epic Montreal début, taking an opportunity to further explore Wakefulness as Resistance with night protest, and soft activism in wakefulness, in awakening against the silence of normalcy or for reconfiguring capitalist rhythms. For us, insomnia is political because it cannot let things rest.

We continue to explore the possibilities of radio as a medium, with insights from great artists on this side of the world, and we’ve also dug into some of the histories of night-time pirate radio broadcasting and listening. There will also be some durational compositions, as well as many late-night sonic incursions in between.

Hosted by @_ah_oui and @nicolasmontgermont with contributions by:

Sisters Akousmatika (Julia Drouhin & Pip Stafford), radio cegeste, diffusion fm (Hethre Contant & Jon Panther), ∏-node, Frances Barrett, Robert Curgenven, Debris Facility Pty Ltd, David Goren, Will Johncock, Tetsuo Kogawa, Tom Melick, Tom Roe, ?ther Varia, Matt Warren with Sally Ann McIntyre & Dani Kirby.

https://www.instagram.com/frontyardorg/,English,2023-10-6,43,0,"Hi friends,

I am hosting a collective Tarot reading session at Frontyard on Sunday October 22nd 3-5pm. Come along!

In a typical Tarot reading, the querent (or questioner) comes to the reader with a problem for which they are seeking guidance. The reader lays out a spread and interprets the cards, tailoring the reading to the querent’s mindset. The ‘answer’ to the problem is in the work of interpretation.

To read Tarot with a larger group is to come together and invest in a shared problem. When I read with people, I try not to exert too much control. As a form of knowledge production, Tarot invites emotional and heuristic responses; it can be cathartic, illuminating, and unsettling. I like that Tarot opens a space for interpretation and negotiation. 

I am often preoccupied with the problem of precarity. In terms of labour, it is the persistent violence of casualisation C trying to build a life from gig work and short-term jobs. Is ‘security’ a pipedream? An illusion? A trap? What is precarity on a damaged planet? I often think of a quote from Anna Tsing: “precarity is not the exception but the condition of our time. Precarity is being vulnerable to others” (2015). Is it possible to embrace precarity is a less alienated way? If any of this resonates with you, let’s work it out together. ??",picture,活动宣传,frontyard-projects
